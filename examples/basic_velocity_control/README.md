# Basic Velocity Control example

## Overview

This example demonstrates **velocity control** on the Axel controller using the SimpleFOC library. It is based on the [official SimpleFOC example](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC/blob/master/examples/motion_control/velocity_motion_control/magnetic_sensor/velocity_control/velocity_control.ino) but has been adapted to work with Axel. The example configures the motor for **velocity-based control**, sets up the on-board encoder and driver, and allows velocity commands via USB-C serial communication.

> **Note:** This is the most basic velocity control example. It does **not** take advantage of Axel's advanced features like current sensing for FOC. If you need to see how current sensing can be integrated into your motor control, please refer to the **`[advanced_velocity_control](./examples/advanced_velocity_control)`** directory or other advanced examples.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate **SimpleFOC's seamless integration** with Axel for velocity control.
- Configure Axelâ€™s specific hardware: **on-board AS5047P encoder** and **DRV8302 driver**.
- Implement **basic velocity control** as a foundation for custom firmware enhancements.

## Setup Instructions

---

### 1. General Hardware Setup

Before using this example, ensure you have assembled your **motor and controller** correctly. Please refer to **[`hardware_setup.md`](./docs/hardware_setup.md)** for a step-by-step guide.

### 2. Connecting the Axel Controller

To run this example, follow these steps:

1. **Power the Board:**
   - Ensure that the Axel controller is connected to a **suitable power source**.
   - The **main power supply** should match the `#define SUPPLY_VOLTAGE` set in `main.cpp`.
2. **Connect USB-C:**
   - Connect **USB-C** to your computer to enable **serial logging, debugging, and control interface**.
3. **Choose an Upload Method:**
   - You can upload the firmware using either **SWD (ST-Link)** or **DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade)**.
   - Edit `platformio.ini` to select the appropriate upload method:

#### **Using ST-Link (default method)**

```ini
upload_protocol = stlink
```

#### **Using DFU (alternative method)**

```ini
; upload_protocol = stlink  ; Comment this out
upload_protocol = dfu       ; Uncomment this to use DFU mode
```

### 3. Configure `#define` Values in `main.cpp`

Before building, make sure to configure the following **user-specific parameters** in `main.cpp` according to your setup:

- **Motor pole pairs:** `#define MOTOR_POLE_PAIRS`
- **Power supply voltage:** `#define SUPPLY_VOLTAGE`
- **Control parameters (PID gains, velocity ramp, etc.)**

## Building and Running the Example

### 1. Build the Project

From the terminal in the project directory, run:

```sh
pio run
```

### 2. Upload the Firmware

```sh
pio run --target upload
```

### 3. Monitor Serial Output

Once uploaded, monitor the serial output:

```sh
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

## Expected Behavior

When you run this example, you can expect it to:

- **Initialize the serial monitor and debugging.**
- **Set up and calibrate the magnetic sensor.**
- **Configure the driver (including any DRV8302-specific settings).**
- **Initialize the BLDC motor with the appropriate FOC settings and PID parameters.**
- **Continuously run the FOC algorithm and adjust the motorâ€™s velocity based on the serial input target.**

## üîå Interfaces

Axel is equipped with multiple communication and control interfaces to ensure maximum compatibility with various applications:

### **Communication Interfaces**
- **x2 SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**  
  - High-speed communication with external encoders and sensors.
  - Can be used as a control bus in specific applications.

- **x1 I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**  
  - Suitable for low-speed sensor interfacing (e.g., thermistors, IMUs, environmental monitors).

- **x1 CAN FD (Controller Area Network - Flexible Data Rate)**  
  - Robust, high-speed communication standard for distributed control systems.
  - Ideal for applications in robotics, automotive, and industrial automation.

- **x1 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**  
  - Commonly used for debugging, calibration, and interfacing with external modules.

- **x1 USB Type-C**  
  - High-speed data exchange.
  - Supports debugging, DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) flashing, and serial communication.

### **Programming Interfaces**
- **SWD (Serial Wire Debug)**  
  - Standard ARM debugging interface.
  - Used for firmware development and real-time debugging.

- **DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade)**  
  - Enables firmware flashing over USB without external programmers.

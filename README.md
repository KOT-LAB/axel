## üöÄ What is Axel?

Axel is an **open-source BLDC motor controller** designed to empower makers, enthusiasts, and researchers. It's a versatile hardware framework for developing custom firmware tailored to your specific application. Think of it as your "**Arduino for BLDC motor control**," combining flexibility, user-friendliness, and powerful performance to support a wide range of projects for both beginners and professionals.

### **Key Advantages:**
- **Flexibility In Motor-Controller Setup:** Features a built-in encoder for direct mounting on the motor and also supports external encoders.
- **Built-in Current Sensing:** Enables true Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for precise and efficient motor control.
- **High-Performance:** Based on the STM32 and a powerful gate driver with external MOSFETs, meets demands of any application.
- **Extensive Connectivity:** Has all most popular interfaces on board, makes the integration with your application seamless.
- **Full compatibility with SimpleFOC:** Makes it easy to start for beginners and enables rapid development for professionals.
- **Flexible Development:** Write your own firmware from scratch to maximize performance, or customize our basic firmware and leverage full SimpleFOC compatibility for rapidness.
- **Beginner-Friendliness:** SimpleFOC support, clear documentation, basic firmware that works out of the box, and an extensive set of examples make getting started easy.

### Applications

- **Legged Robots:** High-speed and high-precision motion control for dynamic robotics.
- **Exoskeletons:** Reliable torque and speed control for assistive devices.
- **Electric Vehicles:** Scalable design for mobility solutions.
- **CNC Machines & 3D Printers:** Precise control in automated manufacturing.
- **Anything else:** The only limit is your imagination!

### **Is Axel for you?**

- **Enthusiasts**: Power *any project* with a *versatile* and *high-performance* BLDC motor controller that‚Äôs easy to integrate and customize.
- **Researchers**: Explore cutting-edge motor control concepts with a platform designed for *experimentation and innovation*. Axel provides a *powerful framework* for developing, testing, and iterating on new ideas.
- **Startups**: Jump straight into developing a *tailor-made solution* for your application. No need to set up manufacturing. Its *rich base of examples* and *SimpleFOC support* make firmware development easy and efficient.
- **Enterprises**: Minimize *external dependencies* by building your *custom in-house solution* on Axel. Perfect for *fast internal development* and *prototyping* before committing to large-scale designs.

## üìà Project Status

**In January 2025, we decided to turn Axel from a solely hardware project into a software one as well.** Now, we've started actively working on `/tests`, `/examples`, and `/firmware`. Expect first commits in February!

### **Current Development Stage:**

- **Production Status:** Axel‚Äôs production is **currently frozen** due to a recently discovered major hardware bug. We are diligently working to resolve this issue.
- **Example Code Development:** Expanding the `/examples` directory with practical applications and demonstrations.
- **Firmware Development:** Actively working on a basic firmware that serves as a solid foundation for your custom firmware development in `/firmware`.
- **Hardware Tests:** Focused on enriching hardware validation tests to ensure reliable performance in `/tests`.
